# Warhammer 40K Simulator — Development Log

> **For AI collaborators:** This document is the ground truth for where this project stands, how it got here, and where it's going. Read this before touching any code. The conversation history lives in the Claude session JSONL but this log captures the non-obvious decisions.

---

## Project Overview

A turn-based, two-player Warhammer 40K tabletop simulator playable remotely via shared link. Browser-only frontend (vanilla JS, no framework) backed by Firebase Realtime Database. No server. No build step.

**End goal:** Three separate repos — this simulator, a standalone roster builder (`roster`), and a Kill Team variant (`killteam`) — merge into one unified platform. All three are owned by Lenny-glitch on GitHub.

## Tech Stack Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend framework | None (vanilla JS) | Matches Kill Team project pattern; no build tooling needed |
| State sync | Firebase Realtime Database | Both players see live updates; free tier sufficient for playtest scale |
| Auth | None (localStorage tokens) | Playtest only — real auth is a future concern |
| Scraping | Node + built-in `https`/`fs` | No puppeteer needed; Wahapedia serves static HTML |
| Unit data in Firebase | `gameData/warhammer-40k/{factionId}/{unitId}` | Separates game data from game state; roster builder can write here too |

---

## Firebase Structure

gameData/warhammer-40k/
  astra-militarum/     { [unitId]: unitDef }
  craftworlds-eldar/   { [unitId]: unitDef }

rosters/{rosterId}/
  meta/  { name, factionId, factionName, pointsTotal, gameFormat }
  units/ [ { instanceId, unitId, unitName, modelCount } ]
```

### Test Roster IDs (Combat Patrol, 495pts each)

| Faction | Roster Name | Firebase ID |
|---|---|---|
| Astra Militarum | Cadian 8th | `-OvwjCrKkEQjW-hYsIFa` |
| Craftworld Eldar | Biel-Tan | `-OvwjCsdqkL4JEk3UdrT` |

These are the IDs players paste in the lobby to start a real game. They're already in Firebase.

## Phase History

### Phase 1 — Core game loop
Two hardcoded squads (Guard Infantry Squad, Eldar Guardian Defenders), 6-phase turn structure, Firebase sync, shareable link. Units built by `buildInitialUnits()` with hardcoded positions. CP tracked but not spendable.

### Phases 2–12 — Mechanics layering
Movement (drag + coherency), shooting (range/LOS/dice), charge (2D6 roll + movement), fight (engagement range), morale (battle-shock), terrain (pre-game placement), deployment (zone-based), initiative roll-off, deferred casualty allocation. Each phase is a separate Firebase write; both players see updates live.

### Phase 13 — Game Size Presets
`GAME_PRESETS` in `state.js`: Combat Patrol (44×60), Incursion (44×60), Strike Force (44×72). Board dimensions are dynamic from `game.boardWidth`/`boardHeight`. Lobby slider lets creator pick size.

### Phase 14 — Wahapedia Scraper
`scraper/scrape_40k.js` scrapes unit stat blocks and weapon tables from Wahapedia.

**Two bugs fixed in this session:**
1. **Multi-word faction keywords** (`['ASTRA']` instead of `['ASTRA MILITARUM']`): lazy regex `/([\s\S]*?)<\/span>/g` stopped at the first inner `</span>`. Fixed with a depth-counting balanced-span walker `extractBalancedTooltipkSpans()`.
2. **All melee weapons showing `type: "ranged"`**: table-header detection was unreliable. Fixed by checking `rangeStr === 'Melee'` per-weapon inside `extractWeapons()` — overrides type regardless of which table the weapon came from.

Scraped data written to Firebase via `write_firebase.js` (HTTPS PUT, no auth needed for gameData path).

**Unit counts:** 134 AM units, 97 Eldar units.

**Stat string format from scraper:**
- `M: "6\""` — already includes the inch mark
- `SV: "5+"`, `LD: "7+"` — already includes the `+`
- `T: "3"`, `W: "1"` — plain numbers as strings

**Weapon fields:** `{ name, type, range (number), attacks (string, may be "D6"/"2D6"), skill (number), S (number), AP (number), D (string) }`

### Phase 15 — Roster Integration

**Part 1:** Two mock Combat Patrol rosters written to Firebase `rosters/` collection (see IDs above).

**Part 2 (current state):**

`roster.js` — `window.RosterLoader`:
- `fetchRoster(rosterId)` — reads `rosters/{id}` from Firebase
- `loadFactionData(factionId)` — reads `gameData/warhammer-40k/{factionId}`, caches in module
- `getUnitDef(factionId, unitId)` — cache lookup
- `buildUnitsFromRoster(roster, faction, boardHeight)` — generates model instances; each model gets `factionId`, `unitId`, `unitGroup`, `label`, `type` (= unitId, for legacy fallback), `wounds`/`maxWounds` from `stats.W`
- `FACTION_MAP`: `{ guard: 'astra-militarum', eldar: 'craftworlds-eldar' }`

`state.js` changes:
- `createGame(playerName, faction, devMode, gameSize, rosterId, devRosterId)` — fetches P1 roster, builds units, stores `rosterId` on player record
- `joinGame(gameId, playerName, rosterId)` — fetches P2 roster, builds units, updates game to `active`
- Battle-shock reads `LD` from `getRosterUnitDef` with `UNIT_STATS` fallback
- `undeployedGroups` uses real `instanceId` strings (e.g. `'unit-001'`), not hardcoded names

`shooting.js` changes:
- `parseStat(val)` — strips `"`, `+` suffixes → int
- `resolveCount(val)` / `avgCount(val)` — handles D6, D3, 2D6 strings
- `getRangedWeapon(unit)` / `getMeleeWeapon(unit)` — reads from `getRosterUnitDef` first, falls back to `UNIT_STATS[unit.type].weapon`
- `getTargetProfile(unit)` — reads `T`, `SV`, `baseRadius` from gameData, falls back to `UNIT_STATS`
- All six attack functions (estimate + resolve, ranged + melee, LOS) updated to use these helpers

`lobby.js` changes:
- `triggerRosterPreview(inputId, previewId, getFaction)` — 500ms debounced roster fetch, shows faction mismatch error or unit list
- Create form: Roster ID input (pre-fillable via `?roster=` URL param) + live preview + dev opponent roster field
- Join form: Roster ID input + live preview (faction auto-assigned, so mismatch detection works)
- `handleCreate` / `handleJoin` both validate and pass `rosterId` to GameState

`game.js` changes:
- `init()` is now `async` — pre-loads faction gameData from both players before subscribing, so first render has stats
- `groupLabelCache` — `{ [groupId]: label }` populated from `u.label` at top of every `render()` call; `groupLabel()` checks this first
- `unitCardsHTML` reads M/T/SV/W/LD/OC from `def.stats`, ranged weapon stats from `def.weapons`, falls back to `UNIT_STATS` for dev presets

---

## Key Invariants

**Never remove `UNIT_STATS`** (`js/units.js`). Dev presets in `game.js` hardcode legacy unit IDs (`guard_0`, `guard_sgt`, `eldar_0`, etc.) that rely on it. These presets let you jump to mid-game states for testing without running through setup.

**`type: unitId` on model instances** — each model has `type = unitId` (e.g. `'cadian-shock-troops'`). This means new code can read `unit.factionId` + `unit.unitId` for gameData lookups, while legacy code that reads `unit.type` still works (finds nothing in `UNIT_STATS` and shows `?`, which is fine for new unit types).

**Script load order in `index.html` matters:**
`firebase-init` → `units` → `roster` → `shooting` → `state` → `lobby` → `board` → `game` → `app`

**Firebase writes are unauthenticated** for `gameData/` and `rosters/` in the current rules. This is intentional for the playtest phase.

---

### Phase 15 — Roster key collision bug (fixed in Phase 16)

Root cause: both rosters used `instanceId` values `unit-001` through `unit-005/006`. When the Eldar player joined, `joinGame` wrote units at Firebase paths like `units/unit-001_0` etc., silently overwriting the AM models at identical paths. Only the Commissar (`unit-006_0`) survived because Eldar only goes up to `unit-005`.

**Fix (roster.js):** Model IDs and `unitGroup` are now faction-namespaced: `guard_unit-001_0`, `eldar_unit-001_0`, etc. No collision possible across factions. Existing games created before this fix must be recreated.

---

### Phase 16 — Post-playtest bug fixes

Five bugs fixed based on real cross-machine playtest findings:

1. **Single-model coherency** — `calcCoherency` required ≥1 neighbour, which no lone model can satisfy → permanent red rings on Castellan, Commissar, Farseer, Leman Russ, Chimera, Wraithlord. Fixed: early-return full OK set when `groupModels.length ≤ 1`; coherency zones never drawn for single-model groups.

2. **Movement M stat** — board.js drag clamp read `UNIT_STATS[unit.type].move` exclusively, never gameData. Added `getUnitMove(unit)` helper that reads `def.stats.M` via `getRosterUnitDef` first (handles `"6\""` strings correctly), falls back to UNIT_STATS. Guards get 6", Eldar 7", Wraithlord 8", vehicles 10".

3. **Melee Attacks (A)** — resolved correctly from gameData when cache is populated. Added `getMeleeWeaponForFighter(unit, fighterIndex)`: fighter index 0 gets the first melee weapon (sergeant's chainsword, A3), all others get the last/basic weapon (close-combat-weapon, A1). This is an index-based approximation — see Known Limitations below.

4. **Dice log overflow** — added `.dice-log-scroll` wrapper with `flex: 1; min-height: 0; overflow-y: auto` inside the right panel. The `min-height: 0` is necessary to allow the flex child to shrink below content height and activate scroll.

5. **Multi-weapon units** — `resolveAttacks` and `estimateAttacks` now iterate `getAllRangedWeapons(unit)` per model (all ranged weapons fire at the chosen target). Shot log entries include `weaponResults` array for per-weapon breakdown in the dice log. Unit card expanded view shows all ranged weapon profiles. See Known Limitations below.

---

## Known Limitations — RETIRED (40K-P3, see Phase 18 below)

### KL-1: Melee weapon assignment uses fighter index, not model role — RETIRED

**Original symptom:** In a 10-model Cadian Shock Troops squad, the first model in the Firebase array got the chainsword (A3) and the rest got close-combat-weapon (A1). Approximated the sergeant/trooper split but depended on array order, not actual model role.

**Retired, not fixed as originally planned.** The `composition`/`role` field this note proposed never landed — the roster export format that shipped instead (`chosenLoadout`, per-unit embedded weapon profiles) still has no per-MODEL role data, only per-squad. `getMeleeWeaponForFighter` (the index hack) is deleted outright; `getMeleeWeapon(unit)` now returns the resolved unit's best-Strength melee profile (ties broken by better AP) when more than one exists — no fight-time weapon-choice UI exists to defer to instead. See Phase 18 / `js/shooting.js`.

### KL-2: Multi-weapon units fire every weapon on the datasheet, not their equipped loadout — RETIRED

**Original symptom:** A Leman Russ fired all 10 ranged weapons simultaneously. In reality a specific Leman Russ has ONE turret weapon and one or two sponson/hull choices.

**Retired.** `chosenLoadout` (written by roster's publish flow, read from `exports/warhammer-40k/{id}` — not the old draft `rosters/{id}` this repo used to read) now drives what a unit actually fires. Full writeup, including a real severity finding beyond this note's own framing (the bug compounds per-model on multi-model squads, not just per-vehicle) and a wargear-pattern distinction found via live data (single-special-model slots vs. uniform squad-wide swaps) — see Phase 18.

---

## Cross-Project Status — 2026-06-27

All three repos share Firebase project `warhammer-5f2f4`. Current state per repo:

| Repo | Branch | Last work | Next |
|---|---|---|---|
| warhammer40k | deploy | Phase 16 complete + Netlify deploy | Phase 17 (KL-1 composition, KL-2 loadout) |
| roster | deploy | Phase 3b Part 1 (unit search + lazy migration for 40k) | Phase 3b Parts 2–3 (40k builder flow + sim integration) |
| killteam | master | KT-2 Part 2 (drag-to-shoot) | KT-2 Parts 3–4 (fight, firing arc) |

The 40k sim (this repo) is **blocked on roster Phase 3b** — Part 3 of that brief is the sim integration that hooks `chosenLoadout` into `buildUnitsFromRoster()`. That's Phase 17 KL-2.

---

### Phase 18 — 40K-P3: Roster Picker + Sim Reads chosenLoadout (2026-07-14)

**Brief:** `briefs/W40K_PART3_BRIEF.md` (supersedes the old, pre-monorepo
`ROSTER_3B_PART3_BRIEF.md`). **Files:** `js/lobby.js`, `js/roster.js`,
`js/shooting.js`, `css/styles.css`.

Two interlocking changes: a real roster picker in the lobby (retiring the
free-text Roster ID fields that produced "child failed: path argument was
an invalid path" on a pasted URL), and the sim actually reading
`chosenLoadout` instead of firing a unit's entire datasheet — closing
KL-1 and KL-2 above.

**Verify-first found the picker and the chosenLoadout fix are the SAME
underlying change, not two separate ones.** `roster.js`'s `fetchRoster()`
read the OLD draft `rosters/{id}` collection — `{ meta, units: [{
instanceId, unitId, unitName, modelCount }] }`, no weapon data at all,
requiring a separate gameData lookup per unit. Only PUBLISHED exports at
`exports/warhammer-40k/{id}` carry `chosenLoadout` plus each unit's own
resolved stats/weapons embedded inline (self-contained, no gameData lookup
needed for the common case). So picking rosters from `exports/` (item 1)
and reading `chosenLoadout` (item 2) both require the same source switch.
**Fallout, expected not fixed:** this repo's own two hardcoded "Test
Roster IDs" (`-OvwjCrKkEQjW-hYsIFa` / `-OvwjCsdqkL4JEk3UdrT`) are drafts,
not exports — confirmed live (`exports/warhammer-40k/-OvwjCrKkEQjW-hYsIFa`
returns null; `rosters/` has it) — they no longer resolve through the
lobby. Same tradeoff killteam's KT-RS made switching to `exports/kill-team`.

**Lobby picker** (`js/lobby.js`): ported KT-RS's `fetchRosterList`/
`renderRosterPickerList`/`selectLobbyRoster` pattern, generalized to
THREE simultaneous picker instances this app needs that Kill Team's
single-roster flow didn't (create-form's own roster, the dev-mode
opponent roster, the join-form's roster) — each filtered to the relevant
faction (`meta.factionId`), reloading when the faction-card selection
changes. Deleted the old debounced single-ID `triggerRosterPreview`/
`rosterPreviewHTML` (redundant once the picker shows everything up
front — same call KT-RS made). Kept a pasted ID/URL field as a fallback
per the brief ("if trivial"): `extractRosterIdFallback()` just takes the
last non-empty `/`-separated segment, since Firebase push keys never
contain a slash either way.

**chosenLoadout resolution** (`js/roster.js`) — the actual KL-1/KL-2
retirement. A roster unit's exported `weapons` array is the FULL
datasheet catalog (every alternative across every valid configuration —
this IS KL-2's root cause); `chosenLoadout` narrows exactly the optional
slots resolved at publish time, keyed by roster's own self-describing
slot name (`Replace X` / `Optional: X` / `Optional (up to N)` — see
`roster/index.html`'s `_parseWargear`). `resolveLoadout()` reads ONLY
those key strings plus a small, targeted read of gameData's
`wargearOptions` prose (already fetched for squadSize fallback, see
below) — NOT a re-implementation of `_parseWargear` itself, just its
"replace X with one/N of the following" pattern family, needed for a
reason verify-first surfaced only by testing against Nox's real
Craftworlds Eldar export, not the brief's own description:

1. **A "Replace X" slot name only identifies the ONE default weapon being
   swapped out — not the other un-chosen alternatives for that same
   slot.** Guardian Defenders' Heavy Weapon Platform slot has FOUR
   alternatives (missile launcher / bright lance / scatter laser /
   starcannon); chosenLoadout only names whichever one was picked.
   Excluding just the named default left the other three still firing —
   a smaller, but still real, residual KL-2. Fixed by parsing gameData's
   `wargearOptions` text (already loaded) for the same "one of the
   following: A B C D" list roster's own picker built from, and excluding
   every alternative by normalized-prefix match (handles "missile
   launcher" prose matching both its "– starshot"/"– sunburst" profiles).
2. **Not every "Replace X" slot means "one special model has this."**
   Guardian Defenders' HWP slot does (ONE Heavy Weapon Platform model in
   an 11-model squad) — that weapon should fire once for the whole squad,
   not once per model. But Wraithguard's own wargear text reads "**All**
   of the models in this unit can **each** have their wraithcannon
   replaced with 1 D-scythe" — every model shares the SAME choice
   uniformly. Conflating these would have made a real 5-model Wraithguard
   squad fire its Wraithcannon once total instead of five times.
   Distinguished by testing the literal "each"/"all ... models" phrasing
   in the wargear sentence itself (`isUniform()`) — the only signal the
   data offers; `resolveLoadout()` returns `chosenPerModel` and
   `chosenOnce` separately, `perModel` tagged accordingly.
3. **`modelCount` is `null` (dropped by Firebase) for every FIXED-size
   unit** — roster only writes a real value for variable-size squads (see
   `roster/index.html`'s `_addOperative`). `buildUnitsFromRoster` now
   falls back to gameData's `squadSize.min` when absent, then 1. Verified
   live: Guardian Defenders (squadSize 11/11) and Wraithguard (5/5) both
   built the correct headcount — the OLD code's flat `modelCount || 1`
   fallback would have built just 1 model for either.

**`js/shooting.js`:** `getAllRangedWeapons`/`getAllMeleeWeapons` read
`unit.equippedRanged`/`equippedMelee` (attached once per squad at
`buildUnitsFromRoster` time) when present, falling back to their existing
gameData/UNIT_STATS path otherwise — old exports without `chosenLoadout`,
and dev presets, "behave as today" unchanged (both paths tag their
weapons `perModel:true` to match). `getMeleeWeaponForFighter`'s index
hack is deleted; `getMeleeWeapon(unit)` returns the resolved set's
highest-Strength profile (AP as tiebreaker) when more than one exists —
no fight-time weapon-choice UI exists to defer to instead, matching the
brief's own stated fallback. **The real fix for KL-2's severity**:
`firingInstances()` in `resolveAttacks`/`estimateAttacks` — a `perModel`
weapon fires once per alive model that can reach/see the target
(unchanged); a once-per-squad weapon fires from exactly ONE eligible
model, regardless of squad size. Verified live: an 11-model Guardian
Defenders squad's Shuriken Catapult correctly fires 22 attacks (11 × 2),
its chosen Missile Launcher fires exactly 1 (not 11) — the actual bug
this brief exists to close, confirmed against real published data, not a
synthetic fixture.

**Testing:** jsdom (real, `runScripts: 'dangerously'`) against LIVE
Firebase reads — no synthetic-only shortcuts for the acceptance case.
Confirmed: the lobby picker renders real rows for Eldar (13 units, 1950pts,
correct name/faction/points/date) and correctly shows the empty state for
Astra Militarum (no AM exports published yet, not a crash); Guardian
Defenders' HWP slot resolves to exactly 2 ranged weapons (Shuriken
Catapult + chosen Missile Launcher, all 4 alternatives and the replaced
default excluded) firing 22 + 1 attacks respectively; Wraithguard's
uniform swap resolves to Wraithcannon only (D-scythe excluded), firing
per-model (5 attacks from 5 models, not 1); Fuegan/Solitaire (no
chosenLoadout at all) resolve their real weapons unchanged, confirming
"no chosenLoadout behaves as today." No live Howling Banshees export
exists yet to test the brief's own named example directly — the
Guardian-Defenders/Wraithguard pair exercises both wargear patterns
(single-special-model and uniform squad-wide swap) the general mechanism
needs to handle, which should generalize to Banshees' Mirrorswords choice
whichever pattern it turns out to use. Test scripts not committed
(one-off, same jsdom pattern WHF's sessions use for this project).

**Commits:** `3fba1a0`.

---

## Current Status (as of Phase 18)

The game is playable end-to-end with real roster data:
1. Creator picks a published roster from the lobby (`exports/warhammer-40k`)
   → creates game → shares link; pasted ID/URL still works as a fallback
2. Joiner picks their own roster the same way → joins → game goes active
3. Terrain placement → Deployment → Initiative roll → 5-turn game loop
4. Unit cards show all weapon profiles from Wahapedia-scraped data
5. Attack pipeline rolls against real T/SV/W/M values from gameData
6. A unit fires EXACTLY its published chosenLoadout — fixed troop weapons
   scale with headcount, a chosen special/replaced weapon fires once for
   the squad or per-model depending on the wargear pattern (Phase 18)
7. Multi-model squads maintain coherency rules; single models exempt
8. Dice log scrolls without affecting board layout; per-weapon breakdown shown for vehicles

**What still uses hardcoded data:** Dev presets (Jump to T1/T2/T3 states) use legacy `guard_0`/`eldar_0` unit IDs from `buildInitialUnits()`. These exist for testing only and are independent of the roster flow.

---

## Convergence Plan (Three Repos → One)

The three projects share a Firebase project and the same faction data in `gameData/warhammer-40k/`. The convergence path is:

1. **Roster builder** (`roster/`) — standalone web app where players build and save rosters to Firebase `rosters/`. Outputs the roster push-key ID.
2. **Kill Team** (`killteam/`) — separate game mode, same lobby/link pattern.
3. **40K simulator** (this repo) — game engine, reads rosters written by the roster builder.

When merged, the lobby will offer game mode selection (40K / Kill Team), and the roster builder will be a shared tool. The `gameData/` Firebase path is the shared data layer all three read from.

---

## Things The Next AI Should Know

- **Don't touch `DEVLOG.md` for task notes** — update it only when phases complete or architectural decisions are made.
- **The scraper is run manually** (`node scraper/scrape_40k.js` then `node scraper/write_firebase.js`). It is not part of the game runtime.
- **Firebase credentials** are in `firebase-config.js` (gitignored). The example file shows the shape.
- **No TypeScript, no bundler, no linting config.** Keep it that way unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Phase numbers** are informal labels from planning docs, not reflected in code. Don't add phase comments to source files.
- **The board is in inches**, not pixels. The canvas renderer scales inches to pixels internally.
- **`roster.js` reads `exports/warhammer-40k/{id}`, not `rosters/{id}`** (40K-P3). Only published exports carry `chosenLoadout` + embedded weapon profiles. The lobby picker sources from the same collection — don't reintroduce a `rosters/`-reading code path without re-deciding this.
- **`perModel` on a weapon object (40K-P3) means "fires once per alive model"; `false` means "fires once for the whole squad."** Set at `buildUnitsFromRoster` time from `roster.js`'s `resolveLoadout()` — fixed troop equipment and UNIFORM wargear swaps (e.g. Wraithguard's wraithcannon-or-D-scythe, "all models can each...") are `true`; a single-special-model slot (e.g. Guardian Defenders' one Heavy Weapon Platform) is `false`. Read `resolveLoadout()`'s own comments before changing this — the distinction was found by testing live data, not assumed.

---

## BON-1 — Generic Bonus Engine landed in data-pipeline (2026-07-02)

Same bonus-resolver work noted in killteam/DEVLOG.md. Specific to this repo:

- `shared/bonus-resolver.js` (master copy lives in data-pipeline) needs to
  be vendored into `warhammer40k/js/bonus-resolver.js` when BON-4 (40k
  integration) starts. `data-pipeline`'s `check-resolver-sync.js` currently
  reports it ABSENT — expected until that copy step happens.
- Confirmed while cross-checking Firebase paths for that work: this repo's
  live-game collection is `games/`, not `games-40k/`. killteam/DEVLOG.md
  has a noted someday-plan to rename to `games-{system}/` — that hasn't
  happened. Don't assume `games-40k/` exists anywhere yet.
- Flagged a real gap in the bonus schema's abstract stat vocabulary that
  will matter when BON-4 wires this up: it has a single `hit` roll-target
  stat with no separate `wound` stat, so Twin-linked, Anti-, Sustained
  Hits, and Lance (all of which modify the Wound roll specifically) came
  back unmapped in `data-pipeline/output/_unmapped_keywords.txt`. Worth a
  vocab decision before BON-4, not something to guess into place then.

## BUG_40K_PREGAME — 5 pre-game blockers ahead of brother game 5 (2026-07-16)

**Item 1 (blocker) — terrain placement infinite loop.** Turn-alternating
"Pass Turn" placement could strand a player with an active turn and no
budget left while the other player still had budget and no way to act.
Replaced with simultaneous placement: both players paint terrain against
their own budget at the same time, each hits "Done with Terrain"
independently (`terrainDone: {guard, eldar}` on the game doc), and the
phase advances to Deployment once both are done. `passTerrainTurn`
removed from `state.js`'s API, replaced by `confirmTerrainDone`.
`board.js`'s paint logic was already budget-scoped per player — no
changes needed there.

**Item 2 — same-faction games (e.g. Eldar vs Eldar) were blocked.** Root
cause: `players.guard`/`players.eldar` conflated two different things —
the structural/positional SLOT (deployment side, turn order, unit
ownership prefix) and the player's ARMY FACTION, derived via
`FACTION_MAP[slot]`. Fixed at the source: `roster.js`'s
`buildUnitsFromRoster` now derives `factionId` from the roster export's
own `meta.factionId` (the export already knows its army), not from the
slot — `FACTION_MAP` survives only as a defensive fallback for a roster
missing `meta.factionId`. `state.js`'s `createGame`/`joinGame` no longer
take a `faction` parameter at all; slot assignment is purely positional
(creator = guard-slot, joiner = eldar-slot) and each player's
`factionName`/`factionId` is stored from their own roster. `game.js` and
`lobby.js`'s hardcoded "Astra Militarum"/"Craftworld Eldar" labels
(game-over screen, initiative screen, player strip, waiting screen, join
form) now read `players.{slot}.factionName` with a slot-keyed fallback
for pre-fix games. Audited `board.js` and `shooting.js` — both already
used `.faction` (slot) correctly for ownership/ally-vs-enemy detection
and `.factionId` for gameData lookups, so neither needed changes; the
`roster.js` fix alone corrects the whole downstream chain. Verified with
a stubbed-Firebase smoke test: both players joining with the same Eldar
roster get distinct slots, no `unitGroup` collisions, and
`shooting.js`'s `findValidTargets` correctly treats the two same-army
groups as enemies of each other, not friendlies.

**Item 3 — roster list gated behind faction select.** Resolved as a
direct consequence of item 2: the "Choose Your Faction" card selector is
gone entirely from `lobby.js`'s create/join forms. The roster picker is
now the first thing shown, loads all published rosters unfiltered
(`loadRosterPicker(..., null, ...)`), and picking a roster is what sets
the faction (per the brief's preferred approach). Pasted roster ID/URL
fallback input is unchanged.

**Item 4 — shooting "no one in range."** Investigated both suspects the
brief flagged: (1) weapon range parsing — `roster.js`'s `tagWeapons`
reads `profiles.RANGE`, and the export's Firebase-key sanitizer
(`_FIREBASE_KEY_MAP` in `roster/index.html`) only remaps `BS/WS` → `bsws`;
`RANGE` is untouched, so this reads correctly. (2) inches-to-board-units
conversion — board `x`/`y` are inches directly (1:1), confirmed via
`state.js`'s `GAME_PRESETS` (`boardWidth`/`boardHeight` match real 40k
table sizes: 44×30/44×60/44×90) and `shooting.js`'s own range-check
(`Math.hypot(...) <= weaponRange`, no scaling factor anywhere). No
root-cause bug found in either place. Regardless, per the brief's
legibility mandate: added `shooting.js`'s `explainNoTargets()`, wired
into both `shootingTargetingHTML` render paths in `game.js`. When a
shooter group has no valid targets, the phase bar now says why — nearest
enemy's distance vs. the longest-ranged weapon's name and range (e.g.
"Nearest enemy is 28.0\" away — Wraithcannon range is 18\"."), or "in
range but blocked by terrain" if in range with no line of sight, or "no
enemy units remain" — instead of a bare "No valid targets in range or
line of sight." Verified with a stubbed smoke test covering all three
cases.

**Item 5 — port-worthy note only.** Logged in `killteam/DEVLOG.md`
(2026-07-16 entry): 40k's deployment auto-advance-to-next-unit is wanted
in KT's Firefight activation loop. Not built — note only, per the brief.

**Testing:** two stubbed-Firebase Node smoke tests (terrain
simultaneous-done ordering; same-faction game creation + enemy-detection)
and one pure-function smoke test (`explainNoTargets`), all deleted after
verification per the project's one-off-test convention — not committed.

## W40K-UX1 — Table Feel Parity: hover, deployment log, layout scroll (2026-07-17)

Brief: `briefs/W40K_UX1_BRIEF.md`. From Nox's brother-game 5 playtest (first
real two-player 40k game, roster chain worked end to end). Brief said to
port killteam's own fixes for all three rather than reinvent — read
killteam/DEVLOG.md's `BUG_KT_PLAYTEST_1_1`/`KT-3`/`KT-5` entries first,
then ported the actual mechanisms (not just the gist) into 40k's
differently-structured codebase (KT is single-file `index.html`; 40k
splits `board.js`/`game.js`/`state.js`/`css/styles.css`).

**Item 1 — enemy hover labels.** Ported KT-3 item 3's exact pattern: a
native SVG `<title>` per token (`board.js`'s `drawUnits`) reading
`"{label} — {wounds}/{maxWounds}W"`, plus a `.token-hoverable` class with
`cursor:pointer` gated behind `@media (hover:hover)` (touch devices never
get a stuck pointer cursor). Readable name comes from `unit.label`
(roster-built games already carry this — see roster.js's
`buildUnitsFromRoster`); legacy dev-preset units (no `.label`) fall back
to the same `guard_squad`/`eldar_squad` names `groupLabel()` already uses,
then the type string. Applies to both sides' live tokens and destroyed
tokens (skull icon) alike. Verified live in a two-army dev-mode game
(13-unit Astra Militarum vs 13-unit Craftworlds Eldar): both sides' tokens
carry correct titles ("Krieg Command Squad — 3/3W", "Wraithguard — 3/3W").

**Item 2 — deployment placement log.** Ported KT-3 item 4's structured-
record reasoning exactly, scoped to the brief's explicit "minimum useful
version": a new `logAction(gameId, record)` in `state.js` pushes to
`games/{id}/actionLog` (schema comment updated), called from `deployGroup`
with `{type:'deploy', faction, playerName, groupId, unitLabel}` — the
caller (game.js's deployment placement handler) already had the deploying
player's name and the unit's real label in scope, so no extra Firebase
read was needed. `describeActionLogEntry()` (game.js) is the only place
that turns a record into English ("Nox deploys Krieg Command Squad") —
unknown record types render as nothing rather than guessing a sentence,
same as KT's own function. Rendered in a new "Log" section of the
deployment screen's left side panel (`actionLogHTML()`), reusing KT's own
`.log-panel-list`/`.log-panel-line` class names (added to `styles.css`,
didn't exist in 40k yet) for a consistent look across both apps. Verified
with two independent browser contexts (real create → join → deploy flow):
one player's deploy write shows "Nox deploys Krieg Command Squad" on
BOTH clients' panels, not just the deployer's own. Not extended to
non-deployment actions (movement/shooting/etc.) — the brief's "Done when"
only requires deployment narration; matching KT-3's full action-log
instrumentation for every phase is real additional surface, not "cheap,"
and wasn't attempted.

**Item 3 — layout scroll (recurring bug class, third occurrence).**
Reproduced first, deliberately, before touching CSS: a real two-army
13-unit game (Aaron's actual roster, `Jon-2000`) forced into the main
turn loop measured `scrollHeight=1436–1468px` against an 800px viewport
at both 1280px and 640px widths — confirmed the bug, not assumed it.
Root cause, read directly off `killteam/DEVLOG.md`'s `BUG_KT_PLAYTEST_1_1`
item 3 and matching exactly: `.screen { min-height: 100vh }` is a floor,
not a ceiling, so `.game-main`'s `flex:1`/`min-height:0`/`overflow:hidden`
never actually contains anything — a long unit list just grows the whole
page. Fixed by giving `#screen-game` a real `height: 100vh` (on top of
the inherited floor, pinning it exactly) plus `#game-content`'s own
`min-height: 0` so its flex children can actually shrink. 40k has no
`#app` wrapper the way KT does (screens are direct `body` children, and
`body` carries no competing padding), so this needed no extra
app-fullbleed toggle — simpler than KT's version by construction, not by
omission. Re-ran the same 13v13 repro after the fix: `scrollHeight ==
innerHeight` (800==800) at both widths.

Found live during verification, same as KT-5 item 2 found for KT: the
existing `.side-panel` was a fixed `210px`/`min-width:210px` — technically
zero page scroll, but at 640px-tiled width that crushed the board to
~220px (barely usable), same "satisfies the literal wording, misses the
point" gap KT-5 already fixed once. Ported the identical fix: `width:
clamp(130px, 15vw, 220px)` instead of a fixed width. Board width recovered
to ~380px at the same 640px viewport post-fix.

### Testing

Real headless Chromium (`.playwright-libs` workaround, borrowed from
`roster/` since `warhammer40k/` doesn't have its own copy — Playwright
itself is already a devDependency here, only the missing system
`libasound.so.2` needed the workaround), real `createGame`/`joinGame`/
`deployGroup` writes against live Firebase, disposable games deleted
implicitly (never referenced again, not cleaned up — matches this
project's existing 40k test-game hygiene). All Playwright scripts
one-off, not committed. Scroll repro/fix (2 viewport widths, before and
after), hover tooltip content on both factions (2), two-browser-context
deployment log narration on both clients (8 checks), lobby boot smoke
test (0 console/page errors).

Files: `warhammer40k/css/styles.css` (`#screen-game`/`#game-content`
height fix, `.side-panel` clamp, `.token-hoverable`, `.log-panel-*`/
`.side-panel-empty`), `warhammer40k/js/board.js` (`drawUnits` tooltips),
`warhammer40k/js/state.js` (`logAction`, `deployGroup` extended),
`warhammer40k/js/game.js` (`describeActionLogEntry`, `actionLogHTML`,
deployment panel wiring).

## 2026-07-17 — BUG_CRITICAL_ROUND6 items 2 & 5: investigation only, no code changed

Brief: `briefs/BUG_CRITICAL_ROUND6.md` (killteam-primary; this
subproject's two items investigated as part of the same session — see
`killteam/DEVLOG.md` for the full brief and its other items). **No
warhammer40k files touched** — a separate concurrent session was
actively editing `js/board.js`/`game.js`/`state.js` while this
investigation ran; kept to read-only grep/Read throughout specifically
to avoid collision, confirmed via `git status` before writing this entry
that DEVLOG.md itself was still clean.

**Item 2 — dead models blocking the Command Phase: audited thoroughly,
not reproduced.** Checked every `.alive`-dependent gate in `game.js`:
`unmovedeGroups`/`unShotGroups`/the charge-queue builder all correctly
exclude dead units; the four `.every(u => u...ThisTurn)` phase-sync
checks (lines ~1386-1436) all correctly `.filter(u => ... && u.alive)`
first; `getPendingCasGroups`/casualty allocation's `isAutoWipe` branch
correctly handles a fully-wiped group. Live-tested two scenarios with
real published rosters (Astra Militarum "Jon-2000" + Craftworlds Eldar,
13 unit-groups each): (a) one group fully wiped (6/6 dead) plus a
1-model group wiped, walked all five phases (movement→shooting→
charge→fight→command) via real `End Phase` clicks — no blocking, no
errors, both dead groups correctly excluded from every "select a unit
to X" list; (b) a mixed-casualty group (2 already dead, `pendingCasualties=2`
more) driven through the real casualty-allocation click-to-select UI —
worked correctly once tested against genuinely-alive tokens (first
attempt clicked models that happened to already be dead by test-fixture
construction, which board.js correctly ignores — a test artifact, not
an app bug, caught by isolating with a direct `dispatchEvent` vs
`elementFromPoint` check). Given item 1's cache-staleness hypothesis and
that every code path checked out clean, this is very plausibly a cache
ghost too — flagging rather than guessing further without a live
re-test.

**Item 5 — 40k weapon stats showing "Rng ? A ? BS ? S ? AP 0 D ?":
root-caused precisely, exact unit not identified.** `game.js`'s
`weaponRow()` (in `unitCardsHTML`) has two paths: a real roster-def
weapon (`w`), or — when that's falsy — a fallback to `lw = ((window.
UNIT_STATS||{})[u.type]).weapon || {}`, the *legacy* hardcoded default-
army stat table from `units.js`. Every field on an empty `lw` reads
`undefined` → renders `'?'`, **except** `AP`, which has its own explicit
`lw.ap !== undefined ? lw.ap : '0'` default — this is the *exact*
mechanism producing "AP 0" while every other field shows "?", confirmed
by reading the ternaries directly, not fabricated. Root cause is one
level up: `def = window.getRosterUnitDef(info.factionId, info.unitId)`
(→ `RosterLoader.getUnitDef`, a plain `cache[factionId][unitId]` lookup
into the flat-pool `gameData/warhammer-40k/{factionId}`) returned null
for whichever unit Nox screenshotted — a `factionId`/`unitId` key that
doesn't resolve in the flat pool, matching the brief's own "key mismatch
after the publish sanitizer?" suspicion exactly. Did not identify the
specific unit (no screenshot to work from, and roster-built `unitId`s
are roster-instance-specific, not something to guess at without the
real export) — next step if this recurs: check the browser console for
`getUnitDef`'s inputs (`u.factionId`, `u.unitId`) for the affected unit
and diff against `gameData/warhammer-40k/{factionId}`'s actual keys.

Files: none (investigation only).

## W40K-UX2 — Board Readability & Deployment Fixes (2026-07-17)

Brief: `briefs/W40K_UX2_BRIEF.md`. Sibling to W40K-UX1, from brother-game
5's second run — his own words are the spec for items 2–4.

**Item 1 — token size reflects base size.** Checked gameData directly
first: `baseRadius` is uniformly `0.5` for every real unit in the flat
pool, vehicles and titanic units included — no per-unit mm data exists
anywhere to read, exactly the situation the brief anticipated. Derived a
coarse visual tier from each unit's own `keywords` instead (real BSData-
sourced vocabulary, not invented): `TITANIC` → 1.4, `VEHICLE`/`MONSTER`/
`WALKER`/`FORTIFICATION` → 0.95, `MOUNTED`/`ARTILLERY` → 0.7, default
(infantry/character) → 0.5 unchanged. New `getTokenVisualRadius()` in
`board.js`, used only by the token-drawing/ghost-preview/drag-highlight
render paths — deliberately NOT wired into `calcCoherency` or any LOS/
range math, which keep the old flat `UNIT_STATS` default, since changing
those would shift real gameplay outcomes (out of scope per the brief's
own "any rules changes"). Verified live against Aaron's real 13-unit
Astra Militarum roster: Leman Russ variants render at 0.95, the
Stormlord (TITANIC) at 1.4, Rough Riders/Artillery Team (mounted/
artillery) at 0.7, every infantry squad unchanged at 0.5.

**Item 2 — deployment zone clarity.** Brother: *"I put my terrain on
your side... we need a way to make it more clear what side you are
starting on."* Root cause: the board's zone tint was static (always
guard-top/eldar-bottom, ~0.07 opacity) and the one PERSPECTIVE-aware
highlight that existed (`deployZone`/`deployZoneFaction`) only appeared
during actual deployment and followed whoever's turn it currently was —
during Terrain there was no perspective-aware indicator at all, and
during deployment it showed the ACTIVE player's zone, not necessarily
the viewer's own. Replaced with a `opts.myFaction`-driven render in
`board.js`: the viewer's own half gets a diagonal hatch pattern (new
`<pattern id="my-zone-hatch">`), a gold outline, and a "YOUR ZONE" label;
the opponent's half is grayed down. This is now constant across turns —
your zone is always yours, whoever's turn it is — wired into both the
Terrain and Deployment phase renders in `game.js` (`buildBoardOpts`,
both `boardOpts` branches). **Bonus (done): warn, don't block.** Terrain
phase now shows "⚠ N of your squares are in the OPPONENT's deployment
zone" if any of the player's own painted squares fall in the other
half — recomputed every render (so it stays accurate through erases,
not a one-shot check), never blocks placement. Verified live: hatch +
label render correctly in both phases, painting in the opponent's zone
triggers the warning without blocking the write.

**Item 3 — undo (deployment + movement).** Brother: *"we need an undo
button."* Ported WHF-5m's phase-scoped snapshot pattern (read
`warhammer-fantasy/DEVLOG.md`'s Phase 8 entry first, per the brief) —
same shape, adapted to 40k's per-group commit model:
- **Movement**: `movementSnapshot` (new game-doc field) is written inside
  `advancePhase()` at the exact moment a player's Movement phase begins
  (same branch that already resets `movedThisTurn`, reusing its own
  `units` read — no extra Firebase round-trip). `undoMove(gameId,
  groupId)` reverts that group's models to their snapshot x/y and clears
  `movedThisTurn`, refusing (returns `{undone:false}`) if the group
  hasn't moved this turn or nothing was actually revertible. Rendered as
  an "Already moved — undo?" list in the movement queue view
  (`movementQueueHTML`'s new `movedGroupIds` param), one button per
  already-moved group.
- **Deployment**: no per-model position snapshot needed — an undeployed
  group is hidden from the board purely by its membership in
  `undeployedGroups`, so undoing a deploy just means putting the group
  back in that list; stale x/y on its models is harmless until the next
  real placement overwrites it. `lastDeploy` (new game-doc field, `{
  faction, groupId, playerName, unitLabel, prevUndeployedGroups,
  hadNextPlayer }`) gets overwritten by every `deployGroup` call — mine
  or the opponent's — which is what makes "the opponent hasn't acted
  since" free to check: `undoDeployment(gameId, faction)` just compares
  `lastDeploy.faction` against the caller. If the undone deploy had ended
  the phase (advanced to Initiative), it's reverted back to Deployment
  too. Deliberately scoped to the deployment phase's own UI only — no
  undo affordance is wired into the Initiative screen, so a deploy that
  ends the phase can no longer be undone once Initiative renders
  (matching the brief's "do not allow undo after any action with
  opponent-visible side effects": initiative rolls can start immediately
  on that screen).

Verified with two real browser contexts (not dev mode — dev mode's
deployment view always follows `turn.activePlayer` for "my" perspective,
which can never reproduce "my own screen, opponent's turn," the exact
case this item needs): the deployer's own screen shows an undo button
after passing the turn to the opponent, the OTHER player's screen does
not; undo correctly restores the undeployed-group count and reverts
`turn/activePlayer`. Movement: `advancePhase` genuinely writes the
snapshot on phase entry, a real commit+undo round-trip restores exact
position and `movedThisTurn`, and a second undo attempt on an
already-reverted group correctly refuses.

**Item 4 — model arrangement within a unit.** Brother: *"make it auto
move them around to keep them from being on top of each other or
leaving weird gaps."* Deployment already auto-arranges (existing
`onDeployPlaced` grid-cluster math) — the real gap was after a move,
since models drag individually with no re-tidy on confirm. Added: on
`btn-confirm-move`, for any group with more than one model, the
raw dragged positions are discarded in favor of a clean grid centered on
their own centroid (same spacing/cols formula as deployment's cluster,
independently reimplemented in `game.js` rather than reaching into
`board.js` for a five-line formula) — direction/intent of the drag is
preserved, per-model overlap/gaps are not. Clamped to board bounds;
terrain-passability of the arranged positions is NOT re-checked
(noted, not fixed, per the brief's own "if not cheap, note it and
stop" — the drag itself already validated the raw positions, and
re-validating a different set post-arrangement is real additional
work). Manual rearrangement was not attempted for the same reason —
auto-tidy was confirmed to be the ask that mattered. Verified with real
mouse-drag interactions (not synthetic state injection): dragged every
model in a 6-model squad to the same overlapping spot, confirmed the
move, and the final Firebase-written positions form a perfect 3×2 grid
at exactly 2" spacing with zero overlaps.

### Testing

Real headless Chromium (`.playwright-libs` workaround, same as
W40K-UX1) against live Firebase throughout, real `createGame`/
`joinGame`/`deployGroup`/`advancePhase`/`confirmUnitMove` calls — no
fixture, no mocked state. All Playwright scripts one-off, not committed.
Notable methodology point carried from W40K-UX1: raw REST writes to
`turn/phase` are fine for pure layout/render checks but **wrong** for
anything whose side effect lives inside `advancePhase()` itself
(`movementSnapshot`) — those need the real client function called, not
the phase value alone.

Files: `warhammer40k/js/board.js` (`getTokenVisualRadius`, zone
hatch/label rendering, `my-zone-hatch` pattern), `warhammer40k/js/game.js`
(`buildBoardOpts` myFaction wiring, terrain out-of-zone warning, undo-
deploy button + handler, `movedGroups`/undo-move UI, move-confirm
auto-arrangement), `warhammer40k/js/state.js` (`undoDeployment`,
`movementSnapshot` write in `advancePhase`, `undoMove`).
